# Territect
Territect is a Lua script for The Powder Toy which dynamically generates random terrain using user-defined presets. These can be used for building saves (as long as the terrain is not the focus of the save or it is a preset save).

# Features
Current version:
* Store, save, and load presets in folders
* Generate layers of material with random local variations in thickness
* Generate randomly-placed veins of material to simulate ores or other random formations
* Run multiple passes of generation
* Temporarily make solids affected by gravity

Future versions:
* Additional generation modes (flatten, clear particles of certain type)
* Ability to control properties of generated particles (temp, deco, life, etc.) within a specified random range
* More horizontal control over terrain features (distribution of veins, cliffs, hills, etc.)
* Tree gen
* Finer control over shape of veins (round instead of diamond, random edges, etc.)
* Solidify non-solid materials temporarily
